# NSEC-WebUI

The WebUI integration for NSEC (my neural network based spelling error correction system).

## Note

I am currently in the process of documenting this and bringing each other module into a usable state. 
This piece of software is not usable on its own but requires other modules to work probably.
These submodules will be released after (code) cleanup and the integration of an easy-to-start documentation.
